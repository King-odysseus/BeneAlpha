## **⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**

## **🎯 Understanding Airbnb’s Kenyan Tax Withholding**

### **Airbnb’s Mandatory KRA Withholding (Effective 2025)**

```
🚨 CRITICAL NEW RULE:
• Airbnb Kenya now WITHHOLDS 5% of all payments
• This is NOT your final tax
• It's an ADVANCE TAX PAYMENT
• You MUST still file returns
• You MUST reconcile what Airbnb withheld vs. your actual liability

📌 EXAMPLE:
Monthly Airbnb earnings: KES 200,000
Airbnb withholds (5%): KES 10,000
You receive: KES 190,000
You still owe: (Your actual tax - KES 10,000)
```

1. **Create a customized tax calculation spreadsheet** for your specific property?
2. **Detail the county‑by‑county permit requirements** for your locations?
3. **Explain how to transition from** personal to company structure when scaling?
4. **Provide sample guest agreements** that protect you legally and for tax purposes?
