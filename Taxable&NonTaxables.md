## 🔑 Critical Compliance Rules for 2026

### ✅ What Goes Into eTIMS

- **Sales transactions** (B2B/B2C invoices)
- **Supplier invoices** you receive (e.g., taxi company invoice for employee transport)
- **NOT employee payroll/benefits** — these are **explicitly exempt** from eTIMS

### 📋 Proper Documentation Flow (Transport Example)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Company hires taxi for employee] --> B[Taxi issues eTIMS invoice TO company]
    B --> C[Company records expense with eTIMS receipt]
    C --> D[Company records KES 3,500 as transport allowance in payroll]
    D --> E[Declare on iTax PAYE return under allowances]
    E --> F[Keep trip log + eTIMS receipt for audit]
```

### ⚠️ KRA's 2026 Validation Rule

> All expense claims on your corporate tax return will be cross-checked against **valid eTIMS invoices from suppliers**.  
> ❌ Missing eTIMS receipts = disallowed expense + penalties
