#### **Penalties for Late Filing (KES)**

```
VAT RETURNS:
• Late filing: 5,000 or 5% of tax due (whichever is higher)
• Late payment: 5% of tax due + 1% monthly interest

INCOME TAX RETURNS:

• Late payment: 5% penalty + 1% monthly interest

PAYE RETURNS:

| Jan 2026 | 48,000             | 32,000                | 16,000          | 20/02/2026   | ITX-2026-001234  |
| Feb 2026 | 52,500             | 28,400                | 24,100          | 20/03/2026   | ITX-2026-001235  |

## **🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR BENALPHA**

1. **Answer the 3 clarifying questions** above so I can tailor advice
2. **Verify your KRA PIN status** immediately if not done
3. **Start maintaining daily records** using these templates
4. **Mark critical deadlines** in your calendar (20th of each month!)
5. **Consult a practicing ICPAK accountant** for your first filing

**Remember:** KRA penalties are steep but avoidable with proper systems. Starting with good records from day one saves stress, money, and audit headaches later.

---

## **📞 WHEN TO CONSULT A PROFESSIONAL**

Seek immediate ICPAK accountant assistance if:

- Your annual turnover exceeds KES 5 million (VAT threshold)
- You're hiring your first employee
- You're entering contracts with government or large corporations
- You're importing/exporting goods
- You receive a KRA audit notice
- You're unsure about any tax obligation

**Best practice:** Engage an accountant quarterly for review, not just at filing time.
